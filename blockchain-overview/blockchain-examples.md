# Blockchain examples

블록체인 기술을 어느 분야에 응용 수 있을까?

**Looking at the wider applications of blockchain**

Because blockchain and Bitcoin are so inextricably linked, it took people a long time to realise that blockchain actually has much wider applications beyond cryptocurrency networks. In fact, blockchain’s potential is so great that many people \(myself included\) believe the technology will revolutionise the way we do business, just like the internet did before it.

Here are just a few examples of the wider applications of blockchain beyond Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies:

* **Executing smart contracts.** Thanks to Bitcoin, we already know that blockchain is great for facilitating digital transactions, but it can also be used for formalising digital relationships through smart contracts. With a smart contract, automated payments can be released once the contract terms have been fulfilled, which promises to save time and help to reduce discrepancies or solve disputes.
* **Maintaining a shared, transparent system of record.** Blockchain is the ideal solution for maintaining a long-term, secure and transparent record of assets \(land rights would be a good example\) that all parties can access securely.
* **Auditing the supply chain.** Blockchain allows users to trace the records of ownership for goods all the way back to the source. As an example of this, Diamond company De Beers has started to use blockchain to trace diamonds from the mine to the end customer. Anyone who wants to verify that their diamonds are free from conflict will have a transparent and complete record.
* **Providing proof of insurance.** Nationwide insurance company is planning to use blockchain to provide proof-of-insurance information. The tool would help police officers, insurers and customers verify insurance coverage instantly, which should help to speed up the claims process.
